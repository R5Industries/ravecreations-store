# Manage Store Catalog (minshop MCP & Sync Utilities)

This skill guides adding and updating products, categories, and images in the store via the `rave-store` Model Context Protocol (MCP) server and the catalog sync script.

The store is based on [minshop](https://github.com/ddyy/minshop), a Cloudflare Workers + D1 ecommerce architecture where records are addressed externally via **prefixed public IDs** (`prod_...` for products, `cat_...` for categories, `ord_...` for orders, `med_...` for media, and `pimg_...` for product gallery images). Numeric database row IDs are strictly rejected across API and MCP boundaries.

## 1. Bulk Ingestion & Updating Script

For adding or updating products from local folders (such as folders containing `product.json` and product image files):

Use [`scripts/sync-products.mjs`](file:///Users/amanda/git/rave-store/scripts/sync-products.mjs):
```bash
# Sync products, categories, and upload/link missing images to remote production (default)
bun scripts/sync-products.mjs /path/to/PRODUCTS

# Or explicitly target local D1/R2
bun scripts/sync-products.mjs /path/to/PRODUCTS --local
```

### What `scripts/sync-products.mjs` Does:
1. **Idempotent Product Sync**: Connects to the store MCP server and creates new products or updates existing ones (`name`, `price_cents`, `stock`, `description`).
2. **Category Hierarchy**: Automatically registers any missing parent categories or subcategories in D1, then assigns the category associations to each product.
3. **Image Upload & Product Association**:
   - Reads image header bytes for dimensions (`width`, `height`).
   - Uploads new image files to Cloudflare R2 (`ravecreations-store-images/media/<hex>.<ext>`).
   - Inserts records into `media` and `product_images`.
   - Sets the product's primary image (`products.image_key`) so the storefront displays the product photo instead of the placeholder.

## 2. Available Store MCP Tools

The `rave-store` MCP server provides two tiers of tools:

### Operator Tier (Admin / Management)
Requires operator credentials (`Authorization: Bearer <MCP_TOKEN>`). Configured automatically in Antigravity, Claude, and ChatGPT Codex:

- `create_product`: Create a new product.
  - `name` (string, required): Product display name.
  - `price_cents` (integer, required): Price in integer minor units (e.g. `2500` for \$25.00).
  - `description` (string, optional): Product description.
  - `stock` (integer, optional, default: 0): Available inventory count.
  - `currency` (string, optional, default: "usd"): Currency code (lowercase).
  - `active` (boolean, optional, default: true): Whether product is visible on storefront.
  - *Returns*: `{ id: "prod_...", slug: "..." }`.

- `update_product`: Update an existing product.
  - `id` (string, required): `prod_...` public ID or existing product slug. Numeric IDs are rejected.
  - `name` (string, optional): Updated product name.
  - `price_cents` (integer, optional): Updated price in integer cents.
  - `description` (string or null, optional): Updated description.
  - `stock` (integer, optional): Updated inventory stock count.
  - `currency` (string, optional): Updated currency code.
  - `active` (boolean, optional): Set true to publish or false to unpublish/hide.
  - *Returns*: `{ id: "prod_...", slug: "..." }`.

- `list_products`: Paginate through catalog items (admin view: includes inactive products and sold counts).
  - `limit` (integer, optional, default: 50, max: 200).
  - `offset` (integer, optional, default: 0).
  - *Returns*: `{ products: [...], total: number, limit: number, offset: number }`.

- `get_product`: Retrieve detailed admin information for one product by its `prod_...` public ID or slug.
  - `id` (string, required): `prod_...` public ID or slug.

### Buyer Tier (Public Catalog & Storefront API)
Always accessible without credentials:

- `browse_products`: Search or list active, in-stock products with public pricing, URLs, image links, and assigned categories.
  - `q` (string, optional): Search query keyword.
  - `limit` (integer, optional).
  - `offset` (integer, optional).
- `get_product_details`: Retrieve full public details, including category associations, variants (`var_...`), and extras (`xtra_...`) by product slug.

## 3. Invariants & Rules

1. **Integer Minor Units for Money**:
   - Always supply `price_cents` as an integer minor unit (e.g., \$15.00 = `1500`, \$99.50 = `9950`).
   - Never pass decimal floating-point dollars to `price_cents`.

2. **Public IDs Only**:
   - Always use prefixed public IDs (`prod_...`, `cat_...`, `med_...`).
   - Product slugs can also be passed as `id` to `get_product` and `update_product`.
   - Never supply numeric database integer IDs; the MCP server will return an explicit error.

3. **Images**:
   - Products require an entry in `product_images` and an `image_key` referencing `media` to show a photo rather than the default placeholder.
